    <h1>Elon Musk</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Elon Reeve Musk</b> (born June 28, 1971) is a businessman known for his 
        key roles in the space company SpaceX and the automotive company Tesla, 
        Inc. Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that 
        operates the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and his role in 
        the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. In November 
        2024, president-elect Donald Trump announced Musk is set to become co-chair 
        of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)[3] in the second 
        Trump administration. Musk is the wealthiest individual in the world; as of 
        November 2024 Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$304 billion.[4]

        Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University 
        of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring 
        citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated 
        at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the 
        University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and </p>

        physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but 
        never enrolled in classes, and with his brother Kimbal co-founded the online 
        city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 
        million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com 
        merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002, Musk acquired US 
        citizenship, and that October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 
        million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a 
        spaceflight services company, in 2002.

        In 2004, Musk was an early investor in electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors,
         Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), providing most of the initial financing and assuming the
          position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, 
          in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company 
          that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed 
          a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded 
          OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year 
          Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brainâ€“computer 
          interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the 
          U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had 
          falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. 
          To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 
          million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company 
          into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. 
          In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.
